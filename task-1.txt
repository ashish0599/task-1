Q 1 : write a blog on difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

Ans:    -HTTP1.1                                                                
     
     1.  It keeps all the requests and responses in plain 
         text format.                                  
      
     2.  It is the most standarized way for a requests and responses.
     
         
             eg: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
             Host: www.example.com

        -HTTP2

      1. It uses the binary framing layer to combine all messages in                                                                            binary format, while still maintains HTTP semantics, such as                                                                           verbs, methods, and headers.
      
      2. It automatically converts all the text formats into binary when 
         introduced to a new protocol and is a protocol for greater performance.

Q 2 : Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript 
 
Ans : Objects are the representation of any kind of entities in any language which 
      represent things by defining its properties with their values. In Javascript, 
      objects may be defined as collection of related data, of primitive or reference
      types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.

      eg :
        var car2 = Object.create(car);
        car.id=3113;
        car.name='audi';
